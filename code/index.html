        <header>What are the Major Arcana of Tarot?</header>
        <p>The Major Arcana of Tarot are a set of 22 cards that are known for being the most significant cards of the tarot deck. These cards represent the many forms or stages of our psyche, starting with number 0, The Fool, and maturing into number 21, The World. Each card is defined by a unique set of qualities, which I have matched with the twelve sections of the Zodiac. </p>
        <p>Explore cards by random selection, or enter your birthday to find the card that represents you.</p>
